```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE)
```

One of the awesome aspects of rmarkdown documents is that they help you avoid calls to `setwd()` and instead they let you use paths relative to your working directory. The problem is that the notion of working directory of an rmarkdown document may be different than what you expect. These are two ways to avoid this problem:

1. Set the working directory to the Project directory using RStudio or 
2. Build relative paths to anywhere within your project using `here::here()`.

This post extends on the problem and on these two solutions.

### The problem

The document you are reading now is an rmarkdown document using the default working directory. Notice that it has a different notion of _woking directory_ compared to the project's working directory.

```{r}
getwd()

usethis::proj_get()
```

Now notice that `here::here()` gets is right.

```{r}
usethis::proj_get()

here::here()
```

### 1. Set the working directory to the Project directory using RStudio or 

You can use RStudio to change this setting from _Document directory_ to _Project directory_. But be careful, this setting goes back to its default every time you rename or move the rmarkdown file -- so you may need to repeat this step.

### 2. Build relative paths to anywhere within your project using `here::here()`.

Alternatively, you can leave the default untouched and build relative paths using `here::here()`.

```{r, error=TRUE}
bad_path <- "content/post/R/dummy.R"
bad_path

# This will fail
readLines(bad_path)
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
good_path <- here::here("content/post/R/dummy.R")
good_path

readLines(good_path)
```
