This is a kind of checklist of my most common steps for adding data to data packages. (If you are serious about building packages you will learn much more at http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/.) 

After building the fundamental infrastructure of a data package (see [how](http://bit.ly/2JkSDiw)) you need to actually add data. Do this from some data-raw/file.R or some data-raw/file.Rmd. These two approaches are standard:

1. Import and clean all data in a single data-raw/data.R file. This is a good idea if all datasets are closely related to each other (e.g. similar source, type, cleaning).

2. Import and clean each dataset in an individual data-raw/data-file.R. This is best if the datasets aren't closely related.

This workflow considers that you may have private data that can't be uploaded to GitHub.


# Create folders and files to store, clean and document data

```R
library(usethis)
library(fs)
```

```R
use_data_raw()
use_r("data.R")
fs::file_copy("R/data.R", "data-raw/data.R")
```

---

In the terminal (send from R script with Control + Alt + Enter)

```bash
git checkout -b dev
git add .
git commit -a -m "Add infrastructure to add raw data."
git pull
git push
```
---

Now, working from some file in data-raw/, keep adding data to data/ with `usethis::usedata()`.

* Place a raw dataset in data-raw/ (manually is OK).
* In data-raw/some-file.R:
    * Document the source of the raw dataset.
    * Clean the dataset.
    * Export the dataset with `usethis::use_data(OBJECT-NAME-GOES-HERE)`.

# Adding private data

```R
use_directory("data-raw/private")
use_git_ignore("data-raw/private")
```
Manually add data to data-raw/private/

---

In the terminal (send from R script with Control + Alt + Enter)

```bash
git add .
git commit -a -m "Add private data to be ."
git pull
git push
```

---

Confirm the private data hasn't been pushed to dev branch.

```R
browse_github()
```

Browse to branch dev > data-raw.

Compare with local version.

Note that private/ exists in local but not remote version. Your private data lives nowhere online.
