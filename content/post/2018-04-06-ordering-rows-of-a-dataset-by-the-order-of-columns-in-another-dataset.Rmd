As you build a dataset you may want to define its columns in a meta-dataset. After some time, the dataset and its meta-dataset may fall out of sync, with the row order of the meta-dataset no longer matching the column order of the dataset. Here is how to fix it.

```{r}
library(tibble)

dataset <- tibble(
  col1 = 1:3,
  col2 = letters[1:3],
  col3 = LETTERS[1:3]
)
dataset

mixed_rows <- tibble::tribble(
  ~cols, ~definition,
  "col3", "Some LETTERS",
  "col1", "Some numbers",
  "col2", "Some letters"
)
mixed_rows
```

Fix.

```{r}
ordered_cols <- match(names(dataset), mixed_rows$cols)
ordered_rows <- mixed_rows[ordered_cols, ]
ordered_rows
```
