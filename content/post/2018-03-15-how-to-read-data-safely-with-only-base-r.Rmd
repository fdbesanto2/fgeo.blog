When you read data into R you may silently introduce some issues that can complicate your data analysis. The most common problems are automatically handled by the `read_*()` (underscore) functions of the __readr__ package -- which I encourage you to use (see [this post](https://fgeo.netlify.com/2018/03/13/2018-03-13-import-dataset/)). But if instead you use the `read.*()` (dot) functions -- that come with R via the __utils__ package -- you need to know about these arguments:

* `stringsAsFactors`: Use `FALSE` to interpret text strings as text strings. Unfortunately, the default converts text strings to factors (read argument `as.is`). If you don't know what a factor is (`?factor`) you most likely don't want it. (Even if you do want factors, your code will be more readable if you explicitly coerce strings to factors later, with something like `as.factor("your-string")`.) In short, always use  `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`. 

* `colClasses`: A character vector of classes to be assumed for each columns. For example, `c(x = "numeric", y = "integer", z = "character")`.

* `na.strings`: A character vector of strings which are to be interpreted as NA values. For example: `c("", "NA", "NULL", "-")`

I emphasize these arguments because they are buried among many other arguments so they are easy to miss. (Sure, the arguments `header` and `sep` are important but you will unlikely miss them because they are in the second and third position of the function's signature (see `?read.table`).]

To show you these arguments in action let's suppose I have a spreadsheet that looks like this:

I can simply import this dataset from the Environment tab of RStudio, using the option Import Dataset > From Text (base) ...

The panel that pops-up will help me to (1) find the file I want to import; (2) preview the dataset; and (3) select values for the most common arguments. (Notice that Strings as factors is checked)

But for reproducibility I prefer to insteada write code. Accepting all defaults -- as you saw in the panel above -- is equivalent to running this code:

```{r}
my_path <- here::here("static/my_dataset.csv")
my_dataset <- read.csv(my_path)
```

And this is the result.

```{r}
my_dataset
str(my_dataset)
```

In this example the defaults are not enough. Here are some problems:

* `x`: I want a double (real number) but instead I got an integer.
* `y`: I want an integer but instead I got a factor. That is because "NULL" was interpreted as the literal string "NULL"; thus the entire column was interpreted first as a text string and then converted to a factor.
* `z`: I want a character string but instead I got a factor.

But I can fix these problem with the arguments you just learned about.

```{r}
my_path <- here::here("static/my_dataset.csv")

my_dataset <- read.csv(
  my_path,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  na.strings = c("", "NA", "NULL", "-"),
  colClasses = c("double", "integer", "character")
)

my_dataset
```

```{r}
str(my_dataset)
```

Now the dataset is ready for analysis.
