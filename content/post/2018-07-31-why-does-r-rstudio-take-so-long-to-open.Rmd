```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

One common reason why R/RStudio take long to open (or even crashes) is that it is set (by default) to re-load objects from previous sessions. This is bad. Really. Each session should be self contained, and you should be able to reproduce your analysis entirely from your script.

What if the objects you need take a long time to produce? You use one script to create the time-consuming objects, then save them. Next time you need those objects you start not from scratch but from your saved object.

First I'll show you how to change your settings to never re-load objects from previous R sessions. Then I'll show you how to save time by writing and then reading objects that take a long time to produce.

### 1. Settings

* Go to _Tools > Global Options... > R General_. Ensure these two settings are  as follows:

* The next step will clean your environment. Before you do that you may want to save it. You can do that in RStudio from the _Environment_ tab.

* Now restart your R session (Shift + Control/Command + F10).

* Your environment should now be empty.

### Saving and re-loading objects that take long to produce

A great way to manage your workflow is to write a script that produces and saves an object, and another script that reads that object and uses it for analysis.

### Example

* Script 1: project/R/write_object.R

```{r}
# This script creates a model that takes a long time to run
model1 <- lm(disp ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
model1

# I'll use this model as
readr::write_rds(model1, "models/model1.rds")
```

* You can now restart my R session (or close and reopen R/RStudio).

Script 2: project/R/read_object.R

```{r}
# Prove that global environment is empty
ls()
```

* Read the object you wrote before and continue your analysis.

```{r}
model1 <- readr::read_rds("models/model1.rds")
model1

model1$coefficients
```
