R packages live most commonly on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/). To install packages that live on CRAN you use the function `install.packages()` which comes by default with R. 
To install packages that live on GitHub you use the function `install_github()`, which comes not by default but with the packages __devtools__ and __remotes__. I recommend __remotes__ because it is lighter. __remotes__ lives in CRAN, so you can install it with:

```
install.packages("remotes")
```

R packages are like any other software. To use an R package -- or any software -- you need to install it once, and then "open" (load) it every time you want to use it. In R you load a package with `library(package)`. Let's open __remotes__: 

```
library(remotes)
```

Now you can use the function `install_github()`. The description and examples of the help file `?install_github()` show you what to do next. You need to feed `install_github()` with a username and a repository name. For example, this is what you should run if you want to install the package __fgeo__ of the organization _forestgeo_:

```
install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

There is a way to save a little typing. You can use `install_github()` without running `library(remotes)`: This is how:

```
remotes::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

That syntax works for any package. For example, had you installed __devtools__, you could also install __fgeo__ with:

```
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

And now of course you need to "open" __fgeo__ if you want to use it:

```
library(fgeo)
```

Or you can use the syntax you just learned to use a specific function. For example:

```
fgeo::fgeo_update()
```

To learn what a package does you can run `help(package = "package-you-want-to-know-about")`. For example:

```
help(package = "fgeo")
```
