This blog is mainly for those who use and build the [__fgeo__ package](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/), but many posts are general enough to engage a broader audience. Most users of the __fgeo__ package belong to The Center for Tropical Forest Science and Forest Global Earth Observations ([CTFS-ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/)) -- a network of scientists interested in better understanding the diversity and dynamics of forests around the world.

I -- the maintainer of the __fgeo__ package and of this blog -- work at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, in Washington DC. I first joined the Smithsonian in 2016 and researched how coral reefs in Bocas del Toro, Panama, have changed over the past 7,000 years in response to human impacts. Before that I did a PhD in ecology (2015) at the University of Queensland, Australia, and a bachelors in marine biology (2008) at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
